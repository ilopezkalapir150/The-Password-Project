# The Password Project

Welcome to The Password Project! Click [this link](https://ilopezkalapir150.github.io/The-Password-Project/main.html) to view a current (but in-progress) version. This software was created by four Swarthmore College students for our SWE class! In 8 weeks, we created a web app that allows students, IT professionals, and others to check passwords against various university password standards to see what standards their password meets and what standards it does not. This will allow for these groups to use stronger passwords in their day-to-day keeping their private information safe. Our solution also provides IT professionals with a framework to research and standardize password policies and provides students with helpful guidelines to create more secure passwords. 

Thank you to [NordPass](https://nordpass.com/most-common-passwords-list/) and to the contributers of the [engish-words](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words) GitHub repo, as we used both resources in the devleopment of our project!
